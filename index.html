        <center><p>This plot shows the correlation between voting category, income, and education. 
            In a loose trend, more frequent voting tends to correlate with higher education and income levels. 
            On the other side, less frequent voting tends to correlate with lower levels of education and income levels. 
            While this loose trend does exist, voters from every category appear in every education and income level.</p></center>
