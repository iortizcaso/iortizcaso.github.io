            In a loose trend, more frequent voting tends to correlate with higher education and income levels. 
            On the other side, less frequent voting tends to correlate with lower levels of education and income levels. 
            While this loose trend does exist, voters from every category appear in every education and income level.</p></center>

        <p>Beyond adding the brief explanation text for each plot, we centered the text and images to make it more pleasing to look at, 
            and we added margins to the page so the text doesn't run right up to the edge of the page. Making these changes increase effectiveness 
            because it makes it easier to read, and doesn't detract from the presentation because it doesn't add elements detrimental to the presentation of the information. 
            The only challenges we faced was figuring out the right code to use for each change which we were able to overcome with some research.</p>
