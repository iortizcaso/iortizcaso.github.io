        <center><h2 style = "font-size:24px"> Does frequency of voting change with income and education levels?</h2></center>
        <center><iframe src = "categories.html" title = "paralell categories plot" width = "1000px"
        height = "600px" frameBorder = "0"></iframe></center>
        <p style = "font-size:18px">This plot shows the correlation between voting category, income, and education. In a loose trend, more frequent voting tends to correlate with higher education and income levels. On the other side, less frequent voting tends to correlate with lower levels of education and income levels. While this loose trend does exist, voters from every category appear in every education and income level.</p></center>

        <center><h2 style = "font-size:24px">How did voter turnout and absentee voting change in Virginia General Elections
            from 2014 to 2022?</h2></center>
        <center><iframe src = "bubble.html" title = "bubble plot" width = "1200px"
        height = "900px" frameBorder = "0"></iframe></center>
        <p style = "font-size:18px">A dramatic spike in absentee voting is seen in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the percentage is still higher than in previous years in 2022. An increase in voter turnout is seen in presidential election years including 2016 and 2020.</p></center>

        <center><h2 style = "font-size:24px">What did voter turnout look like in cities and counties in Virginia in the 2022 general election?</h2></center>

        <p style = "font-size:18px">The percentage voter turnout in Virginia in 2022 varied by county between 33% and 67%. There were to be higher levels of voter turnout in Northern Virginia and along the eastern coast than in parts of Southern and Western Virginia.</p></center>

	<center><h2 style = "font-size:24px">Elements Added</h2></center>
        <p>Beyond adding the brief explanation text for each plot, we centered the text and images to make it more pleasing to look at, we added margins to the page so the text doesn't run right up to the edge of the page, as well as we increased font sizes. Making these changes increases effectiveness, because it makes it easier to read, and doesn't detract from the presentation because it doesn't add elements detrimental to the presentation of the information. In addition to this, enhancing readability was one of our priorties as the combination of font sizes and spaced out sections created an easier website to retain information from. One of the few challenges we faced was figuring out the right code to use for each change and we had some trouble setting up the GitHub pages through the desktop application which we were able to overcome with some research.</p></center>
